# Scribal Exegesis in the Old Greek of Leviticus 25:1–24

In this repository is data associated with my paper, "Scribal Exegesis in the Old Greek of Leviticus 25:1–24. The data was created manually in the included .numbers file (Apple's spreadsheet app). I then exported that data to the enclosed variants.csv file. variants_minus_definite.csv contains all variants except those which concern the addition of definite articles, which was excluded from the paper.

All data is open source. No license.

25:2.1,εἰς τὴν γῆν,בארץ,אֶל־הָאָ֔רֶץ,exchange,word,lexeme,narrowing,word,translation,εἰσέρχομαι,G reads εἰς suggestive of ב in place of אל; a brief query shows that אל seems to be more often glossed with προς. εἰς is sometimes used as well (or the dative). בוא is more frequently used with אל in MT (Jupyter; ~14% in late and early texts). Could the Greek lexeme εἰσέρχομαι have influenced the selection of verb? More data is needed to query this.
25:2.2,ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι ὑμῖν,אשר אני נתן לכם,ø,expansion,clause,specification,adjunct,sentence,intertextuality,Lev 25:2a; Lev 26:27–35,"G borrows the relative clause from the verse's part A; syntactic: the new clause functions in attributive relation to the second word ארץ; the new clause is embedded within another clause, i.e. bracketed, though by nature of its being a relative clause. The specification is now repeated in the apodosis, with the result being that the land is specified as coming from the Lord both before and after entry. Does the refocus here have a more exhortational role rather than simply reflective? Lev 26 implies that the land can be taken away and given to others (look for additional evidence). See Lev 26:34, where the land also rests (only other place, cf. SHEBANQ query), but because the inhabitants have been removed. Here the land makes up for the rest that it had lost while the inhabitants lived on it."
25:3.1.1,τὴν ἄμπελόν σου,הגפנך,כַּרְמֶ֑ךָ,expansion,word,specification,determination,phrase,translation,,G reads the definite article.
25:3.1.2,τὴν ἄμπελόν σου,הגפנך,כַּרְמֶ֑ךָ,exchange,word,lexeme,actant,text,syntax,,"G reads ἄμπελος “vine” rather than the expected ἄμπελων “vineyard.” The latter always translates כרם in the Pentateuch (excluding this chapter). The change resolves the difficulty of the 3fs suffix on תבואתה “its [her] produce” both in Hebrew and Greek. גפן can be either m. or f. (HALOT 200). ἂμπελος is f. (Muraoka 33). The resolution works in either Hebrew or Greek, and is thus not necessarily original to G. The effect, though, is that the referent of “its produce” becomes “grapevine,” a text-level alteration which affects the apparent actant of “produce.” The solution is reached is by literalizing a synechdoche. The MT attests to כרם “vineyard.” The grapevine is a part of a vineyard. The change is affected through the analogy."

This is likely due to the transformation כרם to גפן. In the HB, fruitfuless is associated with the latter in Isa 32:12 and Ps 128:3, but seemingly not with the former (https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/query?version=2017&id=2602). "

25:5.1,καὶ,ו,ø,expansion,word,specification,coordination,text,cohesion,Lev 25:4b,"G reads the ו conjunction, creating a connection with the previous two injunctions in vs. 4b. The continuation mirrors that of vs. 3 where there are two clauses with predicates of תזרע and תזמר (as in vs. 4b) followed by a third clause. This variant represents a concern for cohesion inasmuch as the addition of the waw conjunction is influenced by the preceding clauses in the text. "
25:5.2.1,τὰ αὐτόματα τὰ ἀναβαίνοντα,את הספיחים העלים,אֵ֣ת סְפִ֤יחַ,expansion,word,specification,determination,phrase,translation,,G reads the definite article.
25:5.2.2,τὰ αὐτόματα τὰ ἀναβαίνοντα,את הספיחים העלים,אֵ֣ת סְפִ֤יחַ,expansion,word,lexeme,apposition,phrase,translation,,"G reads M’s one word ספיח as a four word description: τὰ αὐτόματα τὰ ἀναβαίνοντα. That the word ספיח can be translated into Greek without the need for the additional word is clear from 2 Kgs 19:29. The two definite articles look suspiciously like a Hebraic attributive phase (note that the second article is only reflected in Fb2 but is included in the Göttingen text due to the likely haplography with the end of αὐτόματα and τὰ). α͗ναβαίνω regularly translates the verb עלה. (e.g. Gen 31:10), but it is not found anywhere else alongside αὐτόματα.

Excursus: The Hebraizing tendency of the construction at hand is illustrated by a comparison with the MT (Jupyter). In 58% of cases (87 of 150) where this construction is found in the Pentateuch, it reflects a Hebrew original. The construction is also found to be more common in Semiticizing NT books (Matthew vs. Luke; also John, Revelation, cf. saved NT_attributive.txt as counted in Accordance). "
25:5.2.3,τὰ αὐτόματα τὰ ἀναβαίνοντα,את הספיחים העלים,אֵ֣ת סְפִ֤יחַ,exchange,word,morphology,number,phrase,cohesion,Lev 25:11; Lev 25:5a2,"G reads the noun as plural. This may be due to the influence of the plural occurrence of the term in vs. 11. In addition, the change may be caused by cohesion due to the plural ענבי “grapes” in the following clause. Though, in G the plural ענבי is translated with the singular σταφυλή. But the singular noun is regularly used to translate the plural ענבים in Hebrew. If the Vorlage indeed contained the plural, then it would be available to influence the choice of number."
25:5.3.1,τοῦ ἀγροῦ σου,השדך,קְצִֽירְךָ֙,expansion,word,specification,determination,phrase,translation,,G reads the definite article.
25:5.3.2,τοῦ ἀγροῦ σου,השדך,קְצִֽירְךָ֙,exchange,word,lexeme,resolution,phrase,contradiction,Lev 25:4,"G reads שדה rather than קציר. There seems to be an effort to avoid any conflict between קציר “harvest” and לא תקצור “do not harvest.” שדה is a convenient term to substitute, since the harvest is a product of the field and since it is available nearby in vs. 4. The substitution resolves any perceived conflict with the following injunction. 

The change affects an additional awkwardness between ἀναβαίνοντα and this slot. In other words, it makes little sense to say that the plants “go up [in] the harvest.” Rather, plants “go up” (grow) in a field.

One note on whether G represents a variant Vorlage, as addressed two cells above: the resulting phrase את הספיחים העלם השדך comes across as awkward in Hebrew. This kind of long chained construction, with a participle, happens rarely in the Hebrew Bible (14; see https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/query?version=2017&id=2599), and the third element is typically a demonstrative pronoun.

25:5.5.2,τοῦ ἁγιάσματός σου,הקדשך,נְזִירֶ֖ךָ,exchange,word,lexeme,metonymy,word,cohesion,,"G reads קדש “holiness” rather than the MT’s נזיר “untrimmed?” נזיר is translated diversely in the LXX. It can be transliterated as in Judg 13:7, 17:17, Lam 4:7; translated into various verbs for “vowing” as in Num 6:2, 6:13; and euphemistically as “glory” δοξασθεὶς in Deut 33:16. Wevers’ translates the phrase as “the grape clusters which you dedicated,” interpreting the second person genitive pronoun as a subjective genitive (Wevers, Notes, 403). But Wever’s translation overlooks the fact the ἁγίασμα usually refers to a sacred place, often as a gloss for מקדש (Muraoka, LXX, 5). Rather, G appears to be borrowing its change used in the first part of this verse, קציר to שדה, i.e. a place. By interpreting נזיר as a holy “place,” G seems to be interpreting it as a vineyard that has been consecrated. "

There are a number of possibilities. G may read the antecedent as τοῦ ἀγροῦ “field” (vs. 5a) or ἐνιαυτὸς “year” (vs. 5b). It it difficult to discern exactly what is happening here. Note that G also reads a masculine suffix on the same noun in vs. 16, there seemingly in connection with the pronoun הוא. G could conceivably read the ה suffix as an archaic 3ms."

The use of יום here in the plural refers to a general period of time, as it is used in vs. 29b (where G also varies). The change in G results in the 3pl. subject becoming ἐτῶν “years” (though it could be ἔτη ἑπτάκις). While “days” is a general term (hypernym) meaning period of time, “years” is a specific term (hyponym). G collapses the general into the specific."

That σημασία indeed translates (or represents) תרועה and not “sign” as NET translates it is clear from its use in Num 10:5-7, 29:1, 31:6; Ezra 3:12-13; 1 Chron 15:28; and 2 Chron 13:12. 

A motivation for the difference in G can be found in the 3fs demonstrative pronoun, which does not match the 3ms יובל “jubilee.” Introducing תרועה from vs. 9 both solves the grammatical incongruity and creates a stronger connection with the preceding material. The resulting sentence now reads: “The year will be a sound of jubilee for you.” Whereas MT simply states “a jubilee that will be for you,” G specifies 1) that the jubilee is a year (via vs. 9 and 10a), and 2) that it is marked with a “shout,” i.e. the sound of a trumpet.

That G fronts αφεσεως before σημασία allows the latter to abut the feminine demonstrative pronoun, ensuring the connection between the two."

But G seems to read the pronoun as 3ms הוּא. G reads the same correction mechanism here, with the addition of תרועה. However, as seen below, the pronoun is absent, perhaps due to the interaction of it with the 3fs verb תהיה. "

That G’s text would take the former is likely due to the construct form it has been employing of תרועת יובל to solve the gender issues.

While the pronoun הוא is never found in a construct relation in the Hebrew Bible, Sam, or Qumran (based on Accordance search), the more general noun + personal pronoun is found twice in the HB (https://shebanq.ancient-data.org/hebrew/query?version=2017&id=2600), once with היא. G’s text thus represents a feasible reading.

N.B. that Göttingen (Wevers) does not accept the reading of B and A here (which includes αὐτοῦ). And Wevers considers this an “error” since it “makes no sense” (Wevers, Notes, 411). This analysis takes issue with Wever’s assessment."

Thus: “all my statutes” and “all my judgments.” G’s reading derives from Lev 19:37 and 20:22, where the same formula occurs but with the verb שמר. That G’s text is sourced from those verses is made clear by the the fact that both texts have חקתי and משפטי as the object of the same verb within the same clause. G’s text does the same, while in the MT both substantives belong to different object phrases and verbs. With the addition of καί before the second verb, φυλάξασθε, G restructures the clause to accede with Lev 19:37 and 20:22.

Of the two parallel texts, Lev 19:37 shares additional lexemes: the instructions about the fair treatment of neighbors, using the same term, עמית, as Lev 25:14, 15, 17 in 19:11, 15, 17; the instructions not to oppress the sojourner, using the same verb ינה in 19:33 as in 25:14, 17; the exhortation to fear YHWH, ויראת מאלהיך אני יהוה in 19:32 and 25:17 (which also influenced the omission of כי in vs.17.

25:18.1.2,καὶ ποιήσετε πάντα τὰ δικαιώματά μου καὶ πάσας τὰς κρίσεις μου καὶ φυλάξασθε καὶ ποιήσετε αὐτὰ,ועשיתם את כל חקתי ואת כל משפטי ותשמרו ועשיתם אתם,וַעֲשִׂיתֶם֙ אֶת־חֻקֹּתַ֔י וְאֶת־מִשְׁפָּטַ֥י תִּשְׁמְר֖וּ וַעֲשִׂיתֶ֣ם אֹתָ֑ם,expansion,word,specification,coordination,text,intertextuality,Lev 19:37,"G reads a conjunction between משפטי and תשמרו, which is under the influence of Lev 19:37 as discussed above. The word-level change results in a text-level restructuring of the clauses and clause relationships."
25:19.1,τὰ ἐκφόρια,פרֶיה,פִּרְיָ֔הּ,exchange,word,morphology,number,word,translation,,G reads the plural noun.
25:20.1,ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἑβδόμῳ τούτῳ,בשנה השביעת הזאת,בַּשָּׁנָ֣ה הַשְּׁבִיעִ֑ת,expansion,word,specification,demonstrative,phrase,intertextuality,"Ex 14:11; Ex 16:3; Ex 17:3; Ex 32:1, 4, 8, 23","G reads a demonstrative pronoun τούτῳ. There are three general possibilities: 1. G could have inserted the demonstrative simply as a translational element; 2. G could have inserted the demonstrative under the influence of Lev 25:13 where the phrase בשנת היובל הזאת “in this year of jubilee” appears; 3. G might have borrowed the demonstrative from its frequent appearance in the Israelites’ complaints in the Exodus narrative. 

1 is possible, but it is a phenomenon that has not yet been observed in this text (as opposed to, for instance, the frequent addition of definite articles). 2 is likewise possible, but the demonstrative is conspicuously absent from G’s reading of Lev 25:13 (see the note on that variant). Would G have omitted the demonstrative in one place only to be influenced by it further down? It is, of course, possible. 3 is attractive because A) It is significant that G places the demonstrative in the mouth of the Israelites, i.e. it is a strategic location in the text; and B) the near-demonstrative is found in all but one of the Israelites’ complaints in the narratives, sometimes in a prominent position. For instance, in Ex 32, זה משה “this Moses” is fronted at the beginning of the clause and is repeated when Aaron relates the people’s words. In the same story, the people declare: אלה אלהיך “this is your gods” (see also Ex 16:3 “this wilderness” //Num 14:2, and Num 20:5 “this wicked place”). The additional intertextual elements, such as the presence of מה in Ex 15:24 and the similar parallel grammar מה נשתה with Lev 25:20 מה נאכל. The other complaints likewise feature the question particle מה or מי in Ex 14:1, 16:3, 17:3 (but למה). In light of these similarities, the Israelite’s words here in vs. 20, “What will we eat in this seventh year?” very much resemble their complaints elsewhere, a feature that is already present in the MT. G’s addition of the demonstrative only strengthens that connection."
25:21.1.1,τὰ γενήματα αὐτῆς,את התבאתיהּ,אֶת־הַתְּבוּאָ֔ה,exchange,word,morphology,number,word,innertextuality,"Lev 25:15, 16",G reads the plural תבאות “produces.” The reading is seemingly motivated by the fact that the produce is equivalent of “three years.” The plural form is borrowed from vss. 15 and 16.
25:21.1.2,τὰ γενήματα αὐτῆς,את התבאתיהּ,אֶת־הַתְּבוּאָ֔ה,exchange,word,morphology,actant,word,cohesion,,"G reads the 3fs suffix as it has appeared elsewhere in this passage. Here the suffix finds an innerclausal warrant in the form of the 3fs verb עשת, a referent to either שנת “year” or ברכת “blessing.”"
25:22.1,τῶν γενημάτων,התבואת,הַתְּבוּאָ֣ה,exchange,word,morphology,number,phrase,innertextuality,"Lev 25:15, 16",See the same in verse 21.
25:22.2,παλαιὰ παλαιῶν,ישן נושן,יָשָֽׁן,expansion,word,specification,adjunct,phrase,intertextuality,Lev 26:10,"G reads ישן נושן “old that is old” which is derived from Lev 26:10. There are numerous links between this passage and Lev 26, including nearly identical language of blessing promised upon the land: that the land would “give” its yield 26:4//25:19, that the Israelites would eat “to satisfaction” לשבע (26:5/25:19, that they would live in “safety” לבטח in their land (26:5//25:19), as well as other parallels outlined by Bergsma (Jubilee, 82-83). By using the term from Lev 26:10, G is showing an awareness of the subsequent material. It is also creating a link between the prosperity described in that passage and this one. They are viewed as the same.

Wevers’ flat description of this as “leveling” (Notes, 414) falls short of the reflective interpretation found in this variant. "
25:23.1,ἐναντίον μου,לפני,עִמָּדִֽי,exchange,word,lexeme,narrowing,phrase,translation,,G reads “before me.” Perhaps it is reflective nonetheless of עמד. 
25:24.1.1,καὶ κατὰ πᾶσαν γῆν κατασχέσεως ὑμῶν,וככל ארץ אחזתכם,וּבְכֹ֖ל אֶ֣רֶץ אֲחֻזַּתְכֶ֑ם,exchange,word,lexeme,narrowing,clause,cohesion,,"G reads the preposition as כ “according to.” It could be the result of a common confusion between the similar letters כ//ב. But it should not be overlooked that the reading with kaph fundamentally alters the interpretation from “in all the land of your possession, a redemption shall be given for the land” to “according to all the land of your possession, a redemption shall be given for the land.” The first is a simple spatial marker; looks, somewhat reflectively, at the measure of the land in possession.
